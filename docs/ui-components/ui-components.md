# Adding Content in Figma
{: .no_toc }

While not a feature unique to Figma, it is important to be able to add actual context to our application mockup through text boxes! We will be using the Text tool in Figma to add text boxes of different colors and sizes.

## Task 2.1 - Entering Text
**1.** Click on the T icon on the navigation menu above our workspace. This is the Text tool and will turn blue once selected, as shown below. You should also notice your cursor turning into a cross-hair shape, rather than an arrow. 

<div align="center">

</div>

**2.** Click anywhere inside the “Login” frame. This will paste your text box into the frame. You can check you have done this correctly by looking on the Layers Panel on the left-hand side and seeing your Login frame have a new Text box indented below it. 

**3.** Begin typing the content you want to have on your app. For this tutorial, we will be creating Mori, a To Do List app, so we will type in “Manage your tasks better with Mori”.
