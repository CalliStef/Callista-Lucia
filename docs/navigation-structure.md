# Implementing Figma Community Files & Plugins
{: .no_toc }

Figma has a very convenient feature that allows its users to download other programs and files that can add even more customized content and functions to our project. We will be adding a Plugin called **Iconify** along with a file containing illustrations we can use made by another user on Figma.
